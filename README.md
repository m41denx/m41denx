# Welcome to the Insanity HQ!

My name is Alexander, otherwise known as [M41den](https://m41den.com), and I will be your host for today.

I'm a Full Stack developer and student of Computer Science at [Voronezh State University](https://vsu.ru/).

If you want to dm me, all my contacts can be found on [m41den.com](https://m41den.com). 
And yes, I can make you a website for your business needs (incl. figuring out your brand identity, style, color palette, etc.)

My primary skill and my delight. 
From one-page landings to complex UIs — it can be done right.

And most importantly, it's not just Figma mockups. Check these out:

* [HYPRR](https://hyprr.space/) - My flagship project, the first gaming cloud platform in its kind
* [CenterCTF](https://centerctf.ru/) - [[Github]](https://github.com/m41denx/centerctf.ru) - That one time official CTF 
sponsored by some government education org decided it would be quite nice to not pay me for the site
* [FruitSpace](https://fruitspace.ru/) - [[Github]](https://github.com/FruitSpace/fruitspace.ru) - My previous project. TOP-1 GDPS hosting in Russian-speaking countries.
* SSA CSF - [[Github]](https://github.com/m41denx/ssa-csf) - That other time when a student was used to secure funding for my university science association
* DronePost - [[Github]](https://github.com/m41denx/drone-frontend) - That third time when big company decided to outsource their work to students for free
